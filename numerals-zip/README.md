# Roman Numerals #

This is a simple assignment which main goal is to evaluate simple coding skills in scala and basic unit testing capabilities. When solving it please consider, by order of priority, the following points:

- Your solution must produce always correct results.
- Your code should be understandable, preferably self-explaining.
- Your Code should be clean, beautiful and/or fast.

In this package you have an SBT template with the basic infrastructure you will need to solve the problem in hand. If you use external libraries which are not already present in the template, you will need to be prepared to explain your choice.

Please copy all contents to a folder of your choice, initialize a Git repository there, and develope your solution under version control. When you are finished, please point us to a public Git repository where we can find your solution (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket,...).

## Problem ##

Write a function that converts [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) to their integer value representation.

For instance:

```scala
numeralsToInteger("I") // 1
numeralsToInteger("XL") // 40
```

- Consider that the input is always correct (i.e. you don't need to do error checking), and numerals with integer value over 3000 won't be provided.
- Implement your solution in `co.enear.Numerals`
- Write unit tests that prove your solution is correct. You can use the stub in `co.enear.NumeralsSpec` (which uses specs2) or use your preferred test framework and testing approach.
- Both your code and tests should compile and run successfully.

## Important notes ##

- If you need any clarification do not hesitate to ask
- You should not take mor than three ours to solve this assignment.
